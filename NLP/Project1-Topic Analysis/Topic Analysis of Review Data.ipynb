    "\n",
    "A popular mobile phone brand, Lenovo has launched their budget smartphone in the Indian market. The client wants to understand the VOC (voice of the customer) on the product. This will be useful to not just evaluate the current product, but to also get some direction for developing the product pipeline. The client is particularly interested in the different aspects that customers care about. Product reviews by customers on a leading e-commerce site should provide a good view."

    "  - No need to provide POS tag to lemmatizer for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove stopwords and punctuation (if there are any). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a topic model using LDA on the cleaned up data with 12 topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Print out the top terms for each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - What is the coherence of the model with the c_v metric?\n",
